Figure 2. Scenarios: The toolkit ingests flow-time series at specific locations, which can include multiple climate scenarios. These can be in the form of hydrographs at specific gauges. Hypothetical climate and adaptation scenarios are represented by different hydrographs at {{< meta n_gauges_to_plot >}} example gauges ({{< meta gauges_to_plot >}}) out of the total ({{< meta n_gauges >}}) gauges; these were developed for demonstration purposes only. Climate scenarios illustrated include the historical base level (E), 0.5 times the base level (A), and 2 times the base level (I). Adaptation options illustrated include no additional flow (1; no adaptation), addition of 201 ML/day throughout September to December (2), and addition of 6001 ML/day throughout September to December (3).

Figure 3. Baselining: Scenarios can be compared by determining the amount of change in flow (delta) from a set base level. Here, the difference from the historical base level (E1) is illustrated at {{< meta n_gauges_to_plot >}} example gauges ({{< meta gauges_to_plot >}}) under three climate scenarios: A (0.5x), E (historical base level/no change), and I (2x) and three adaptation options 1 (no adaptation), 2 (+201), and 3 (+6001).

Figure 4. The toolkit incorporates causal networks that describe the environmental objectives for a system. In the current example these causal networks are extracted from the Murray-Darling Basin Long Term Watering Plans (LTWPs), which sets environmental watering requirements (EWRs), objectives, and long-term targets for key water-dependent plants, waterbirds, fish and ecosystem functions. A measure of the Pass/fail outcomes for each EWR pertaining to particular objectives, targets, or groups can be illustrated on the causal network. Colours indicate the proportion of EWRs passed for each objective at one gauge in the Macquarie--Castlereagh?

Figure 5. Scenario comparison for different planning unit areas. A broad-scale measure comparison can be estimated from the proportion of environmental watering requirements (EWRs) that are achieved under each scenario for each planning unit. This illustrates simply that all planning units are likely to be affected by the changes in the flow, however, the Lachlan may be least sensitive to such changes. This does not illuminate which EWRs may be more important to particular environmental assets or which assets are more sensitive to particular scenarios. This illustration includes three climate scenarios: A (0.5x), E (historical base level/no change), and I (2x) and three adaptation options 1 (no adaptation), 2 (+201), and 3 (+6001). Panels a and b illustrate the same data with a emphasizing the amount of difference between scenarios and b emphasizing spatial patterns.

*EDITS: 1) currently using a work around to label the scenarios (its the x axis label)*

Figure 6. Fine-scale scenario comparison for different planning unit areas. Drawing the links from the causal network allows illustration of the number of EWR achieved that pertain to particular environmental objectives in each planning unit area. Thus, we can see which individual environmental objectives or target groups may be most sensitive. Not all EWR are applicable in all locations and there are not equal number of EWR in each category. The MAX column illustrates the total number of EWRs for reference. Where the max column does not exist, those objectives are not relevant to that particular planning unit. This demonstration suggests that waterbirds may be most sensitive in the Macquarie--Castlereagh planning area, owing to failure to meet the EWRs for waterbird objectives WB1 (Maintain the number and type of waterbird species) and WB2 (Increase total waterbird abundance across all functional groups). This illustration includes three climate scenarios: A (0.5x), E (historical base level/no change), and I (2x) and three adaptation options 1 (no adaptation), 2 (+201), and 3

Figure 7. Maps allow large-scale visualization of environmental objectives under various scenarios. Evaluation may be best achieved at a large-scale for some environmental objectives where some locations or areas can compensate for losses in other areas. For example, waterbird breeding in one or a few planning unit areas may be sufficient to meet basin targets for fledgling recruitment (WB? And WB?). In these situations, specific locations are likely important and hence a spatially explicit visualization is necessary. Polygon colors indicate the proportion of EWR passed for each objective in each planning unit area. In panel B, we highlight one enviornmental objective (WB1) under one scenario (A1) to illustrate the proportion of EWR passed for that objective (point colour) at each gauge location (points). This illustration includes three climate scenarios: A (0.5x), E (historical base level/no change), and I (2x) and three adaptation options 1 (no adaptation), 2 (+201), and 3 (+6001).

Figure 8. Quantitative scenario comparison for different planning unit areas. Scenarios can be compared on an axis that defines the amount of change from a set base level (x-axis; see baselining fig 3). Here, the change in flow for each scenario is relativized to the historical baseline. These plots highlight disproportionate steps in the responses in relation to flow shifts for particular environmental objectives. For example, where points are connected with a steeper angle a small increase in flow gives a relatively great increase in the proportion of EWRs that are met. These could be highly economical points to add water to the system if these thresholds are representative of processes in the system. Colous indicate different target groups; shading indicates different environmental objectives within those groups. This illustration includes three climate scenarios: A (0.5x), E (historical base level/no change), and I (2x) and three adaptation options 1 (no adaptation), 2 (+201), and 3 (+6001).

Figure 9. Direct comparison of outcomes from adaptation option scenarios relativized to the historical baseline. Smoothed fits for all environmental targets in each target group highlights which planning units are most sensitive for each target group and the thresholds at which target groups may be particularly sensitive or where adaptation options could influence target outcomes. For example, something about no differentce between adaptation options 3 adn 4 for most target groupd. Stepwise deifferences between adaptation options 1, 2,and 3 in most cases for native fish and ecological function. Not much difference between adaptation options 1 and 2 for waterbirds - same for native veg and other speceis , except when climate leads to changes in flow \< 1. Colors and lines indicate adaptation options. Error ribbons... This illustration includes all climate scenarios shown in table 1 (the historical base level occurs at 1) and all adaptation options: 1 (no adaptation), 2 (+201), 3 (+6001) and 4 (

Figure 10. Scenario comparison for a whole catchment. A broad-scale measure for comparison can be estimated from the mean proportion of environmental watering requirements (EWRs) across planning units. This illustrates an overall environmental outcome for each climate and adaptation option scenario, potentially highlighting where thresholds in changing flows associated with climate sceanrios occur and where adapatation options are effective or ineffective to modify environmental outcomes. The MAX cell illustrates a best-case scenario (all EWR pass) for reference. This illustration includes all climate scenarios shown in table 1 (climate scenario E = the historical base level) and all adaptation options: 1 (no adaptation), 2 (+201), 3 (+6001) and 4 (+12001).
