Some spatial units and networks are needed for spatial and value-dimension aggregation. Users can supply their own, but HydroBOT includes a set of [spatial data](spatial_data.qmd) and [causal networks](causal_overview.qmd) relevant to the Murray-Darling Basin and EWRs.

HydroBOT also includes example hydrographs suitable for example analyses in both csv and netcdf formats in `extdata`. To access, use

``` R
system.file('extdata/testsmall/hydrographs', package = 'HydroBOT')
```

for csvs or

``` R
system.file('extdata/ncdfexample/nchydros', package = 'HydroBOT')
```

for netcdfs.

For this website, we use a larger set of example scenarios that are too large to provide with the package but make more interesting demonstrations. These are in the `more_scenarios` directory in this repository, and created [here](scenario_creation.qmd).
