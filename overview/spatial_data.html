<p>The <a href="https://github.com/MDBAuth/WERP_toolkit" style="font-size: 11pt;">{werptoolkitr}</a> package provides a standard set of spatial data, generated in <code>data_creation/spatial_data_creation.qmd</code>. Here, we make quick plots of the data so we know what it looks like.</p>
<p>The datasets are <code>bom_basin_gauges</code> (points), and <code>basin</code> (the MDB as a single polygon), <code>sdl_units</code>, <code>resource_plan_areas</code>, and <code>cewo_valleys</code>. Relevant to the case study- the original polygon used was the Macquarie-Castlereagh in the sdls. The crs all match from the creation.</p>
