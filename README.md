# HydroBOT demonstrations

This is a simple demonstration of capacity and use of the [HydroBOT](https://github.com/MDBAuth/WERP_toolkit) R package. It is primarily a collection of Quarto notebooks that demonstrate the use of the package and are available to clone or copy to develop other analyses using the package.

See the [github pages site](https://mdbauth.github.io/HydroBOT_website/) built from these notebooks.

## Developers/users

See the [developer doc](developer.md) for getting set up, especially on specific MDBA systems.
