## Overview

The toolkit proper begins with hydrographs as inputs. The creation of those hydrographs, and particularly their modification to create scenarios is therefore typically a step that occurs prior to the use of the toolkit. For the demonstrations here, however, we generate some example scenarios from historical hydrographs. In a very simple case used for most of the capacity demonstration simply multiplies short hydrographs by 4 and 0.25 and puts them in a standard toolkit input format using the [simple scenario notebook](scenario_creation_demo_R.qmd).

A more complex set of scenarios designed to test the toolkit and module sensitivity and be a more complete example is created from scaling historical flows according to future runoff scenarios. This setup is done in notebooks that [pull the historical data](flow_scaling.qmd) and [scale that data and save it in the standard format](scaling_scenarios.qmd).
