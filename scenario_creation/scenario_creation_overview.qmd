## Overview

The toolkit proper begins with hydrographs as inputs. The creation of those hydrographs, and particularly their modification to create scenarios is therefore typically a step that occurs prior to the use of the toolkit. For the demonstrations here, however, we generate some example scenarios from historical hydrographs. For the purposes of capacity demonstration we simply multiply short hydrographs and put them in a standard toolkit input format using the [simple scenario notebook](scenario_creation_more.qmd).

A more complex set of scenarios designed to test the toolkit and module sensitivity and be a more complete example is created from scaling historical flows according to future runoff scenarios. This analysis is done in a [separate github repo](https://github.com/MDBAuth/toolkit-flow-scaling).
